    bio: 'Garance is a senior engineering manager at Factorial, where she works remotely. She is focused everyday on leading others to success: in her teams in particular, and in the wider engineering organisation in general. When she is not working, you will have better chances finding her hiking in the Pyrenees mountains than in front of a laptop',
    summary: 'We talk a lot about imposter syndrome lately, especially in minorities in tech communities, and especially regarding developers who pivoted in their career. But imposter syndrome can strike anyone, no matter their background or actual skills. In fact, it has little to do with objective abilities: you can be a Microsoft MVP and still be crippled with self-doubt. I won’t cheer you back up with “be confident!” and other pep talk, but I will give you strategies to put in place to gain more self confidence. If you’ve ever had a little voice telling you “no, let it go, the others know more” or “you won’t be able to do that, don’t even try”, this talk is for you. By the end, you will be armed with tools to shut that voice, and replace it with positive action. I won’t cure your imposter syndrome, but if you put in the effort, it will be a world of difference!',

    lang: '',
    bio: 'Antonella is a Software Engineer at Factorial and a math enthusiast. Shes a frontend lover and now trying to expand her horizons jumping to the dark side [the backend]. Originally from Venezuela she decided to leave everything behind to start a new adventure in Barcelona. She believes in the power that technology has to impact positively peoples lives and strives for it.',
    summary: 'Console.log is a powerful resource for debugging and there’s no shame in it, especially when you’re learning to code in JavaScript. But you will reach a point where basic logging is not enough as the complexity of the codebase increases. Therefore, at that point, it becomes necessary to level up the debugging game. At first, it may seem overwhelming to dive into new debugging tools, but fortunately, there are a few simple ones that can help us become good bug hunters. In this talk, we’ll focus on the basics of debugging JS in Chrome with Dev Tools, some tips, tricks, and do’s and don’ts. And finally, we will also cover how to use the React developer tools extension as a bonus.',

    lang: '',
    bio: 'I am a Software Engineer with 7 years of experience building software. I am passionate about helping more women join the Technology scene which drove me to start and be apart of groups like Django Girls Kampala and the Women Passion program in Uganda. I moved to Barcelona about 5 years ago and I currently work at ThoughtWorks, a global software consultancy.',
    summary: 'As developers, we want to write good quality code that delivers value to our clients. But often, we are forced to take certain design decisions that may not be the best for the future, in order to go to production as soon as possible and receive fast feedback, hence creating tech debt. But is tech debt bad? For teams that do not do trunk based development, often tech debt is a hindrance to deploying a feature to production as soon as possible due to prolonged pull request discussions brought about by some code design decisions made. Changing how we view tech debt could save the business a lot of money by going fast to production and allowing teams to start doing things. This approach avoids the analysis paralysis effect of finding perfection from the start. Bearing in mind that in an agile world, architectures and software requirements change. Tech debt can be handled in an evolutionary way(making a design decision in the last responsible moment) meaning regardless of what we think fits for the software in future, we postpone the decision for when the need arises, but document it(to keep track of it) and prioritise it as we see best. The goal of this talk is not to encourage teams to accumulate tech debt, but rather why tech debt should not be a blocker for a release or going to production. Tech debt is always there, teams have to be aware of it and learn how to manage it.',

    summary: 'Environment and workplace safety are more important concern than ever. Big Data and AI are two closely related technologies that, together, allow the optimization of processes and decision making. Nowadays we can transform big data into insights allowing them to make changes that will improve the safety and soustainability of the workplace. But, as digital working becomes more common, employers may need to implement new working practices that consider how they impact in their mental health.',
